According to a leading research, around 36% of employees cite a lack of recognition as their primary reason for employee dissatisfaction.

Hence lack of recognition is the single largest factor that later leads an employee to scout for other opportunities and eventually leading to attrition.

Often such exits are not captured as "lack of recognition" as the root cause but are often camouflaged as reasons like "I need a better salary, I need better opportunity, I need onsite", etc.

But the fact is that at least 36% of your employees would not have even thought about looking for other opportunities if you as a leader had sown a culture of recognizing your people, even a pat in the back would do the trick.

Building a system where recognition and feedback are at their core is less a technical matter that can be solved using technology and is a lot to do with the company culture. The tools and technologies like Certify Me.Online is just going to act as an accelerator if you have got your company culture right.
